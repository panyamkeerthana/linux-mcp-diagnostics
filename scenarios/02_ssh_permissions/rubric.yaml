dimensions:
- tool_use: Evaluates whether the assistant correctly selected, ordered, and used
    tools, and how it handled tool execution outcomes.
  grading_type: score
  scores:
    0: Required tool not called at all or tool use actively hindered progress.
    1: Tool called but with incorrect parameters OR wrong order (if order matters).
    2: Tool called with correct order and parameters, but call count outside min/max
      bounds (e.g., too many or too few calls).
    3: All applicable checks pass - tool called with correct count, correct order
      (if order matters), correct parameters.
- problem_identification: Evaluates whether the assistant accurately identified the
    root cause of the user's stated problem.
  grading_type: binary
- factual_accuracy: Evaluates whether all stated facts and data values provided by
    the assistant are correct based on the available information.
  grading_type: binary

      flow.
    3: Exceptionally clear, well-organized, and easy to follow.
- error_handling: Evaluates the assistant's ability to recognize and appropriately
    respond to errors encountered during tool execution or data retrieval.
  grading_type: score
  scores:
    0: Failed to recognize or address errors, leading to no progress or incorrect
      outputs.
    1: Recognized some errors but failed to recover or adapted poorly, leading to
      continued issues.
    2: Recognized most errors and attempted recovery, but with some inefficiencies
      or missed opportunities.
    3: Effectively recognized and recovered from all errors, adapting its strategy
      as needed to achieve the goal.
- actionability: Evaluates if the provided solution or next steps are practical, clear,
    and directly address the identified problem, enabling the user to resolve it.
  grading_type: score
  scores:
    0: Provided incorrect, harmful, or no actionable steps to resolve the problem.
    1: Provided incomplete or partially incorrect steps, requiring significant further
      user intervention or clarification.
