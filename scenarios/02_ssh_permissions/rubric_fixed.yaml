  scores:
    0: Required tool not called at all, or tools used completely incorrectly, hindering
      the task.
    1: Tool called but with incorrect parameters OR wrong order (if order matters).
      Significant issues with tool usage or poor error handling.
    2: Tool called with correct order and parameters, but call count outside min/max
      bounds, or some inefficiencies/minor errors in handling.
    3: All tools used with correct count, correct order (if order matters), correct
      parameters, and errors handled appropriately.

    is factually correct.
  grading_type: binary
- solution_correctness: Evaluates whether the proposed solution is technically accurate
    and appropriate for the identified problem.
  grading_type: binary
- information_completeness: Evaluates whether all information relevant to the user's
    request was provided.
  grading_type: score
  scores:
    0: No relevant information provided.

  scores:
    0: Completely unintelligible or no response.
    1: Poorly organized or difficult to understand.
    2: Generally clear but could be improved.
    3: Exceptionally clear and well-organized.
- diagnostic_efficiency: Evaluates how efficiently the assistant navigated the investigation
    to reach a conclusion, minimizing redundant or ineffective steps.
  grading_type: score
  scores:
    0: Investigation was severely inefficient, with many irrelevant or repetitive
      steps.
    1: Investigation had significant inefficiencies or took several unnecessary steps.
    2: Investigation was generally efficient, but with minor redundancies or slightly
      prolonged steps.
    3: Investigation was highly efficient, directly addressing the problem with minimal
      unnecessary actions.

  successful_journal_log_retrieval:
    category: Tools
    weight: 3
    dimension: tool_use
    criterion: The assistant must successfully retrieve journal logs for the 'sshd'
      unit to diagnose the SSH issue, especially after failing to read /var/log/secure.

      authentication error found in the logs.
  problem_diagnosis_correctness:
    category: Reasoning
    weight: 3
    dimension: problem_diagnosis_accuracy
    criterion: The assistant must correctly identify that the SSH failure is due to

  solution_chown_correctness:
    category: Reasoning
    weight: 3
    dimension: solution_correctness

    category: Reasoning
    weight: 3
    dimension: solution_correctness
