dimensions:
- diagnosis_accuracy: Evaluates whether the assistant correctly identified the root
    cause of the SSH authentication failure.
  grading_type: score
  scores:
    0: Failed to identify the problem or provided completely incorrect diagnosis.
    1: Partially identified the problem but missed the permission/ownership root cause.
    2: Identified permissions as an issue but didn't fully explain the specific directory
      or file problems.
    3: Correctly identified incorrect permissions and/or ownership on {{problem_directory}}
      and/or {{authorized_keys_path}} as the root cause of SSH authentication failure.
- problem_identification: Evaluates the effectiveness of the investigation and evidence
    gathering process.
  grading_type: score
  scores:
    0: Failed to gather relevant diagnostic information.
    1: Gathered some information but missed critical evidence.
    2: Gathered most relevant information with minor gaps.
    3: Comprehensively gathered all relevant diagnostic evidence.
- solution_correctness: Evaluates whether the proposed solutions would actually resolve
    the SSH authentication problem.
  grading_type: score
  scores:
    0: Solutions would not fix the problem or would cause additional issues.
    1: Solutions are partially correct but incomplete or would only partially resolve
      the issue.
    2: Solutions would work but are missing important details or best practices.
    3: Solutions are completely correct and would fully resolve the SSH authentication
      issue.
- solution_completeness: Evaluates whether the suggested solutions include all necessary
    steps for successful implementation.
  grading_type: binary
- factual_accuracy: Evaluates whether all information provided by the assistant, including
    diagnostic details and command outputs, is factually correct.
  grading_type: binary
- clarity_and_organization: Evaluates the readability, structure, and overall presentation
    of the assistant's response.
  grading_type: score
  scores:
    0: Response is unintelligible or completely unorganized.
    1: Response is difficult to understand or poorly structured.
    2: Response is generally clear and organized but could be improved.
    3: Response is exceptionally clear, well-structured, and easy to follow.
criteria:
  root_cause_identification:
    category: Diagnosis
    weight: 5
    dimension: diagnosis_accuracy
    criterion: The assistant correctly identified that incorrect permissions and/or
      ownership on {{problem_directory}} and/or {{authorized_keys_path}} are the
      root cause of the SSH authentication failure.
  log_evidence_gathering:
    category: Investigation
    weight: 3
    dimension: problem_identification
    criterion: The assistant gathered relevant log evidence (from SSH/system logs)
      that demonstrates the permission/ownership issue, regardless of the specific
      tool used to retrieve the logs.
  logical_troubleshooting_approach:
    category: Reasoning
    weight: 3
    dimension: clarity_and_organization
    criterion: The assistant followed a logical troubleshooting approach, such as
      checking logs, examining file permissions, and verifying user/group ownership,
      in a methodical manner.
  factual_accuracy_log_message:
    category: Accuracy
    weight: 2
    dimension: factual_accuracy
    criterion: 'The response correctly references the relevant log message indicating
      the permission/ownership issue: ''{{ssh_dir_issue_log_message}}''.'
  factual_accuracy_problem_directory:
    category: Accuracy
    weight: 2
    dimension: factual_accuracy
    criterion: The response correctly identifies '{{problem_directory}}' as the problematic
      directory.
  explanation_of_permission_strictness:
    category: Reasoning
    weight: 2
    dimension: clarity_and_organization
    criterion: The assistant clearly explains why SSH is strict about permissions.
  effective_problem_solving:
    category: Problem Solving
    weight: 2
    dimension: solution_correctness
    criterion: The assistant demonstrated effective problem-solving by adapting to
      obstacles (e.g., permission denied errors, inaccessible files) and finding
      alternative approaches to gather necessary diagnostic information.
  correct_ownership_remediation:
    category: Remediation
    weight: 4
    dimension: solution_correctness
    criterion: The recommended solution correctly addresses ownership issues on {{problem_directory}}
      (e.g., setting ownership to {{chown_command_user}}).
  correct_directory_permissions_remediation:
    category: Remediation
    weight: 4
    dimension: solution_correctness
    criterion: The recommended solution correctly addresses .ssh directory permissions
      (e.g., setting to {{chmod_dir_permissions}}).
  correct_key_permissions_remediation:
    category: Remediation
    weight: 4
    dimension: solution_correctness
    criterion: The recommended solution correctly addresses authorized_keys file permissions
      (e.g., setting to {{chmod_key_permissions}}).
  solution_completeness:
    category: Remediation
    weight: 3
    dimension: solution_completeness
    criterion: The recommended solution includes all necessary steps to resolve the
      SSH authentication issue (ownership and permissions for both directory and
      authorized_keys file).
