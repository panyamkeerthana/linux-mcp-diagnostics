      in parameters/execution.
    1: Tool called but with incorrect parameters or wrong order (if order is critical).
    2: Tool called with correct order and parameters, but call count outside expected
      bounds (e.g., redundant calls).
    3: All applicable checks pass - tool called with correct count, correct order
      (if relevant), and correct parameters.

    flow, including planning, executing steps, and updating progress.
  grading_type: score
  scores:

    2: Followed a reasonable plan but with minor inefficiencies, missed opportunities,
      or slight inaccuracies in progress tracking.
    3: Executed a clear, logical, and efficient workflow, adapting as needed and accurately
      tracking progress.

    findings, and requests to the user.
  grading_type: score
  scores:
    0: Completely unintelligible or no response.

    the user's initial request.
  grading_type: score
  scores:
    0: No relevant progress made towards completing the task.

      solution.
    3: Fully completed the task, including verification where applicable, or clearly
      outlined the remaining steps for the user.
