dimensions:
- first_diagnosis_accuracy: Evaluates whether the assistant correctly identified the
    first root cause (disk space issue).
  grading_type: score
  scores:
    0: Failed to identify the disk space problem.
    1: Identified disk space as an issue but didn't locate the specific file.
    2: Identified disk space issue and located the DISK_HOG file but missed details.
    3: Correctly identified disk full, located {{disk_hog_filename}} in {{disk_hog_path}},
      and understood it as the cause.
- second_diagnosis_accuracy: Evaluates whether the assistant correctly identified the
    second root cause (permission issue) after addressing the first.
  grading_type: score
  scores:
    0: Failed to identify the permission issue.
    1: Identified there's still a problem but didn't pinpoint permissions.
    2: Identified permission issue but didn't specify the exact directory/owner.
    3: Correctly identified permission denied on {{log_permission_path}} and that it
      needs {{owner_user}}:{{owner_group}} ownership.
- sequential_troubleshooting: Evaluates whether the assistant followed a logical sequential
    approach to diagnose and resolve both cascading issues.
  grading_type: score
  scores:
    0: No logical approach or completely random investigation.
    1: Attempted investigation but missed the sequential nature of the problems.
    2: Recognized multiple issues but didn't clearly sequence the resolution steps.
    3: Clearly followed a sequential approach - diagnose issue 1, fix it, diagnose
      issue 2, fix it.
- solution_correctness: Evaluates whether both proposed solutions would actually resolve
    the cascading failures.
  grading_type: score
  scores:
    0: Solutions would not fix the problems.
    1: One solution correct but the other incorrect or missing.
    2: Both solutions generally correct but missing important details.
    3: Both solutions completely correct and would fully resolve both issues.
- solution_completeness: Evaluates whether all necessary remediation steps for both
    issues are included.
  grading_type: binary
- clarity_and_guidance: Evaluates the readability, organization, and helpfulness of
    the response.
  grading_type: score
  scores:
    0: Completely unintelligible or no response.
    1: Poorly organized or difficult to understand.
    2: Generally clear but could be improved.
    3: Exceptionally clear, well-organized, with actionable guidance for both issues.
criteria:
  identified_disk_space_issue:
    category: Diagnosis - Issue 1
    weight: 4
    dimension: first_diagnosis_accuracy
    criterion: The assistant correctly identified the "No space left on device" error
      (Errcode {{error_code_disk_space}}) as the first blocker preventing {{service_name}}
      from starting.
  identified_disk_hog_file:
    category: Diagnosis - Issue 1
    weight: 4
    dimension: first_diagnosis_accuracy
    criterion: The assistant correctly identified {{disk_hog_filename}} in {{disk_hog_path}}
      as the large file ({{disk_hog_size}}) causing the disk space issue.
  identified_permission_issue:
    category: Diagnosis - Issue 2
    weight: 4
    dimension: second_diagnosis_accuracy
    criterion: The assistant correctly identified the "Permission denied" error (errno
      {{error_code_permission}}) on {{log_permission_path}}/{{log_file_name}} as the
      second blocker.
  identified_incorrect_ownership:
    category: Diagnosis - Issue 2
    weight: 4
    dimension: second_diagnosis_accuracy
    criterion: The assistant correctly identified that {{log_permission_path}} has
      incorrect ownership (root:root instead of {{owner_user}}:{{owner_group}}).
  sequential_problem_solving:
    category: Approach
    weight: 5
    dimension: sequential_troubleshooting
    criterion: The assistant demonstrated a sequential troubleshooting approach - investigating
      the first issue, proposing a fix, then investigating why the service still fails
      after addressing disk space.
  correct_disk_remediation:
    category: Remediation - Issue 1
    weight: 3
    dimension: solution_correctness
    criterion: The solution correctly addresses the disk space issue by removing/deleting
      {{disk_hog_filename}} from {{disk_hog_path}}.
  correct_permission_remediation:
    category: Remediation - Issue 2
    weight: 3
    dimension: solution_correctness
    criterion: The solution correctly addresses the permission issue by changing ownership
      of {{log_permission_path}} to {{owner_user}}:{{owner_group}}.
  complete_resolution_steps:
    category: Completeness
    weight: 3
    dimension: solution_completeness
    criterion: The solution includes all necessary steps - remove DISK_HOG, fix ownership,
      and restart the service.
  clear_guidance:
    category: Communication
    weight: 2
    dimension: clarity_and_guidance
    criterion: The response provides clear, actionable guidance for resolving both
      cascading issues in the correct order.
