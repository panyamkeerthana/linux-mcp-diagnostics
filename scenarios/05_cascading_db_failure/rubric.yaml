dimensions:
- tool_use: Evaluates whether the assistant correctly selected, ordered, and used
    the available tools to gather necessary information.
  grading_type: score
  scores:
    0: Required tool not called at all.
    1: Tool called but with incorrect parameters OR wrong order (if respect_order=true).
    2: Tool called with correct order and parameters, but call count outside min/max
      bounds (e.g., redundant calls).
    3: All applicable checks pass - tool called with correct count, correct order
      (if respect_order=true), correct parameters (if params specified).
- diagnostic_accuracy: Evaluates whether the assistant accurately interpreted the
    gathered information and correctly identified the root causes of the problem.
  grading_type: binary
- problem_resolution_strategy: Evaluates the assistant's overall approach to solving
    the problem, including identifying solutions and handling its own limitations.
  grading_type: score
  scores:
    0: No attempt at problem resolution or strategy is completely incorrect/irrelevant.
    1: Identified some aspects of the problem but the proposed strategy is incomplete
      or partially incorrect.
    2: Identified the core problem and proposed a largely correct strategy, but missed
      some nuances or failed to fully account for limitations.
    3: Accurately identified the core problem(s), proposed a comprehensive and correct
      resolution strategy, and effectively handled tool limitations by providing clear
      manual steps.
- completeness_of_response: Evaluates whether all requested information was provided
    in the final output.
  grading_type: score
  scores:
    0: No relevant information provided.
    1: Missing most requested information.
    2: Some information provided but incomplete.
    3: All requested information comprehensively provided.
- clarity_and_guidance: Evaluates the readability, organization, and helpfulness of
    the assistant's explanation and any provided instructions.
  grading_type: score
  scores:
    0: Completely unintelligible or no response.
    1: Poorly organized or difficult to understand.
    2: Generally clear but could be improved.
    3: Exceptionally clear and well-organized, with actionable guidance.
- adherence_to_request: Evaluates whether the assistant addressed all parts of the
    user's initial request.

  diagnostic_accuracy_service_status:
    category: Accuracy
    weight: 3
    dimension: diagnostic_accuracy
    criterion: The assistant correctly identified that the `{{service_name}}.service`
      is in a `failed` state.
  diagnostic_accuracy_disk_space_error:
    category: Accuracy
    weight: 3
    dimension: diagnostic_accuracy
    criterion: 'The assistant correctly identified the ''No space left on device''
      (Errcode: {{error_code_disk_space}}) error from the service logs.'
  diagnostic_accuracy_permission_error:
    category: Accuracy
    weight: 3
    dimension: diagnostic_accuracy
    criterion: 'The assistant correctly identified the ''Permission denied'' (errno:
      {{error_code_permission}}) error for the MariaDB log file at `{{log_permission_path}}/{{log_file_name}}`.'
  diagnostic_accuracy_root_disk_full:
    category: Accuracy
    weight: 3
    dimension: diagnostic_accuracy
    criterion: The assistant correctly identified that the root filesystem `{{disk_mount_point}}`
      is `{{disk_usage_percent}}` full with only `{{disk_avail_space}}` available.
  diagnostic_accuracy_disk_hog_identification:
    category: Accuracy
    weight: 3
    dimension: diagnostic_accuracy
    criterion: The assistant correctly identified `{{disk_hog_filename}}` with a size
      of `{{disk_hog_size}}` in `{{disk_hog_path}}` as the primary cause of the disk
      space issue.
  problem_resolution_strategy_tool_limitation:
    category: Reasoning
    weight: 3
    dimension: problem_resolution_strategy
    criterion: The assistant correctly identified its own tool limitations (inability
