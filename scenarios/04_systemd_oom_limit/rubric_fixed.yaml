  tool_check_service_status:
    category: Tools
    weight: 3
    dimension: tool_use

  tool_read_drop_in_file:
    category: Tools
    weight: 3
    dimension: tool_use
    criterion: The assistant must use the 'linux-mcp-server__read_file' tool to inspect
      the content of the identified drop-in configuration file '/etc/systemd/system.control/chronyd.service.d/50-MemoryMax.conf'.
    tool_calls:

      prohibited: []
  tool_no_prohibited_actions:
    category: Tools
    weight: 2
    dimension: tool_use
    criterion: The assistant must not call any destructive or inappropriate tools
      for initial diagnosis or resolution.
    tool_calls:
      respect_order: true
      required: []
      optional: []
  factual_accuracy_oom_result:
    category: Accuracy
    weight: 3
    dimension: factual_accuracy
    criterion: The assistant correctly identifies that the 'chronyd' service
      failed with result 'oom-kill'.
  factual_accuracy_drop_in_file_identification:
    category: Accuracy
    weight: 3
    dimension: factual_accuracy
    criterion: The assistant correctly identifies '{{drop_in_file_name}}' as
      the specific drop-in configuration file causing the issue.
  factual_accuracy_memory_max_value:
    category: Accuracy
    weight: 3
    dimension: factual_accuracy
    criterion: The assistant correctly states that the 'MemoryMax' setting in the
      drop-in file is '{{memory_max_raw_value}}' (equivalent to '{{memory_max_display_value}}').
  factual_accuracy_mem_peak:
    category: Accuracy
    weight: 2
    dimension: factual_accuracy
    criterion: The assistant correctly identifies the service's peak memory usage
      as '{{mem_peak_display_value}}'.
  reasoning_diagnosis_correctness:
    category: Reasoning
    weight: 3
    dimension: factual_accuracy
    criterion: The assistant accurately diagnoses the root cause as the 'chronyd'
      service being killed by the OOM killer due to an extremely strict 'MemoryMax'
      limit.
  solution_effectiveness_revert_command:
    category: Output
    weight: 3
    dimension: solution_effectiveness
    criterion: The recommended solution to revert the custom configuration using 'sudo systemctl revert chronyd.service'
      is appropriate and technically sound for removing the systemd drop-in.
  solution_commands_accuracy:
    category: Output
    weight: 3
    dimension: solution_effectiveness
    criterion: The recommended commands (revert, daemon-reload, restart, verify) are
      syntactically correct and use 'sudo' where appropriate.
  completeness_solution_steps:
    category: Completeness
    weight: 2
    dimension: completeness
    criterion: The assistant provides all necessary sequential steps for the solution,
      including reverting the config, reloading daemon, restarting the service, and
      verifying status.
  clarity_problem_explanation:
    category: Output
    weight: 2
    dimension: clarity_and_organization
    criterion: The assistant clearly explains the problem, its cause, and the rationale
      behind the recommended fix in an easy-to-understand manner.
