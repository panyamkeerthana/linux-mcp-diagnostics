- tool_use: Evaluates whether the assistant correctly selected and utilized tools
    to gather necessary information.
  grading_type: score
  scores:
    0: Required tool not called at all
    1: Tool called but with incorrect parameters OR wrong order (if order is respected)
    2: Tool called with correct order and parameters, but call count outside min/max
      bounds
    3: All applicable checks pass - tool called with correct count, correct order
      (if order is respected), correct parameters (if params specified)
- problem_diagnosis: Evaluates the assistant's ability to accurately identify the
    root cause of the issue based on available information.
  grading_type: score
  scores:
    0: No diagnosis or incorrect diagnosis provided.
    1: Partial or superficial diagnosis, missing the core issue.
    2: Correctly identified the main issue but lacked detailed explanation or context.

- solution_appropriateness: Evaluates whether the proposed solution directly and effectively
    addresses the identified problem.
  grading_type: score
  scores:
    0: Solution is incorrect, harmful, or completely irrelevant.
    1: Solution is partially correct but insufficient or has significant flaws.
    2: Solution is generally correct but could be more robust or efficient.
    3: Solution is fully appropriate, effective, and directly resolves the problem.
- instruction_completeness: Evaluates whether the provided instructions or steps for
    the solution are comprehensive and include all necessary actions.
  grading_type: score
  scores:
    0: Critical steps are missing, making the solution unusable.
    1: Several important steps are missing or are vaguely described.
    2: Most steps are present, but minor omissions or ambiguities exist.
    3: All necessary steps are clearly provided, allowing for successful implementation.
- factual_accuracy: Evaluates whether all factual statements, data interpretations,
    and explanations provided by the assistant are correct.
  grading_type: binary
- clarity_and_organization: Evaluates the overall readability, structure, and ease
    of understanding of the assistant's response.
  grading_type: score
  scores:
    0: Response is unintelligible, disorganized, or absent.
    1: Response is difficult to follow due to poor organization or unclear language.
    2: Response is generally clear but could benefit from better structure or conciseness.
    3: Response is exceptionally clear, well-structured, and easy to understand.
criteria:
  call_get_service_status:
    category: Tools
    weight: 3
    dimension: tool_use
    criterion: The assistant must call `linux-mcp-server__get_service_status` to check
      the service status on `{{host_ip}}` for `{{service_name}}`.
    tool_calls:
      respect_order: false
      required:
      - linux-mcp-server__get_service_status:
          min_calls: 1

      prohibited: []
  call_read_drop_in_file:
    category: Tools
    weight: 3
    dimension: tool_use
    criterion: The assistant must call `linux-mcp-server__read_file` to inspect the
      content of the identified drop-in configuration file `{{drop_in_file_path}}`
      on `{{host_ip}}`.
    tool_calls:
      respect_order: false
      required:
      - linux-mcp-server__read_file:
          min_calls: 1

            host: '{{host_ip}}'
      optional: []
      prohibited: []
  diagnosis_oom_cause:
    category: Reasoning
    weight: 3
    dimension: problem_diagnosis
    criterion: The assistant correctly identifies that the `{{service_name}}` service
      is being killed by the OOM killer due to a strict memory limit.
  diagnosis_memory_max_file:
    category: Reasoning
    weight: 3
    dimension: problem_diagnosis
    criterion: The assistant correctly identifies `{{drop_in_file_name}}` as the drop-in
      file enforcing the memory limit.
  factual_memory_max_value_interpretation:
    category: Accuracy
    weight: 3
    dimension: factual_accuracy
    criterion: The assistant correctly states that `MemoryMax={{memory_max_raw_value}}`
      corresponds to `{{memory_max_display_value}}`.
  factual_mem_peak_value_match:
    category: Accuracy
    weight: 2
    dimension: factual_accuracy
    criterion: The assistant correctly notes the `Mem peak` usage of `{{mem_peak_display_value}}`
      and relates it to the `MemoryMax` limit.
  solution_revert_command:
    category: Output
    weight: 3
    dimension: solution_appropriateness
    criterion: The assistant correctly recommends `sudo systemctl revert {{service_full_name}}`
      as the primary fix to remove the custom memory limit.
  instructions_daemon_reload:
    category: Completeness
    weight: 2
    dimension: instruction_completeness
    criterion: The provided instructions include reloading the systemd manager configuration
      using `sudo systemctl daemon-reload`.
  instructions_restart_service:
    category: Completeness
    weight: 2
    dimension: instruction_completeness
    criterion: The provided instructions include restarting the service using `sudo
      systemctl restart {{service_name}}`.
  instructions_verify_status:
    category: Completeness
    weight: 1
    dimension: instruction_completeness
    criterion: The provided instructions include verifying the service status after
      the fix using `systemctl status {{service_name}}`.
  factual_revert_explanation:
    category: Accuracy
    weight: 2
    dimension: factual_accuracy
    criterion: The assistant correctly explains that `systemctl revert` deletes the
      `{{drop_in_file_path}}` directory and its contents.
